# CiviCRM-OSDI Project Updates

Hi everyone! I'm Andy, and I'm working on the OSDI integration project for GSoC 2018. If you want more information about what this project is all about, check out the GitLab [here](https://lab.civicrm.org/everykittysdaydream/CiviCRM-OSDI). The source code is [here](https://github.com/4ndygu/civicrm_osdi/tree/pipeline). the OSDI standard is a set of standards for interoperability between products in progressive movements. For more information about OSDI, click [here](http://opensupporter.github.io/osdi-docs/).

Our stakeholders and I had a conversation about the basic use case for an OSDI integration, and we agreed that the most valuable use case for Civi is to support two-way sync between Civi and another OSDI-compliant endpoint so that a set of resources would stay up to date between both endpoints. To do this, we settled on Action Network as a valuable starting system and are working towards using OSDI to sync contacts in a group (or in all groups) in CiviCRM with the contacts in a group in Action Network.

I'm proud to say that our current product supports two-way sync between People resources in Action Network and Contact resources in CiviCRM. We've implemented this functionality via a series of API endpoints that allow users to specify the endpoint, the key, a dedupe rule ID that they want the import/export functions to obey, and a set of fields that the CiviCRM user can stipulate *must* exist to be sync'd. Furthermore, we've provided a set of API calls that are configurable in the scheduled jobs page:

Updater.update

Updater.export

These calls will pull contacts from and push contacts to the external endpoint every day via a scheduled job. This sync allows new updates on CiviCRM or on Action Network to be propagated across the two servers. From the vantage point of a CiviCRM user who wants to run campaigns from Action Network or runs a non-profit, this is very useful -- they can now use this module to easily take groups of users in CiviCRM and port them over to Action Network with little manual entry or labor.

Our next steps are to expand this functionality extensibly so that we can support other OSDI compliant providers and have the same kind of syncing functionality. This sync will only work for OSDI-compliant endpoints that support the People resource and also implement the Person Signup Helper. In addition to making our product extensible, we plan to expand our product integration to other OSDI resources like Donations or Activities. Our full project schedule is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKpw9utQs0l8kPT_cCEmm_RE82CSHBaCg53vIOdbFuw). 

Secondly, we want to support CiviCRM to CiviCRM sync. This entails implementing a person signup helper and an export endpoint like Action Network does. If we can provide this, then users of multiple CiviCRM instances can sync up data sources for them and decrease drift between their contacts.
